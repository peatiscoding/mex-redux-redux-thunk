# Redux-Redux-Thunk Example

This project is created to accompany my Medium's Blog [Post](https://medium.com/@peatiscoding/typescripts-with-redux-redux-thunk-recipe-fcce4ffca405).

The project aim to illustrate how to use [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) along with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) language.

To run the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/peatiscoding/mex-redux-redux-thunk.git
cd mex-redux-redux-thunk
yarn
yarn start
```

Please note that this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
